# Wallet
 Wallet initially course from EatTheBlocks.
 This course was very interesting, but very old (based on solidity 0.4.x) and simple

 I'm getting back on it to :
 - migrate from truffle to hardhat              (in progress)
 - improve the contract                         (not started)
 - implement more tests                         (not started)
 - build a brand new frontend based on Angular  (not started)
